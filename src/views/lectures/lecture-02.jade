    h1 HTML Compiler

  section
    p Angular's HTML compiler allows the developer to teach the browser new HTML syntax.

  section
    p
      | It allows you to attach behavior to any HTML element or attribute and even create new HTML
      | elements or attributes with custom behavior.

  section
    p Angular calls these behavior extensions
      strong  directives.

  section
    p Angular comes pre-bundled with common directives which are useful for building any app.

  section
    p Later, we'll learn how to create our own directives that are custom to our application.

  section
    p So what does a directive look like?
    br
    .text-center
      pre.
        <code class="html" data-trim>
        &lt;div ng-bind="exp"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        </code>

  section
    p Now, back to the compiler

  section
    p The compiler is an Angular service which traverses the DOM looking for directives.

  section
    p The compilation process happens in two phases.

  section
    h3 Link
    p Traverse the DOM and collect all of the directives.

  section
    h3 Compile
    p
      | Combine the directives with a scope and produce a live view. Any changes in the scope model are
      | reflected in the view, and any user interactions with the view are reflected in the scope model.

  section
    p This makes the scope model the single source of truth.

  section
    h2 Scope

  section
    p Scope is an object that refers to the application model.  It is an execution context for expressions.

  section
    p Scopes are arranged in hierarchical structure which mimic the DOM structure of the application.

  section
    p We'll discuss directives and scope in detail later.

  section
    p Let's see the HTML compiler in action

  section
    p ng-init evaluates a JavaScript expression on scope.
    p ng-bind takes a variable on scope and sets the content of the element to it.
    br
    pre.
      <code class="html" data-trim>
      &lt;div ng-init="myVar = 1 + 2;"&gt;
        &lt;p ng-bind="myVar"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      </code>

    p What will the DOM look like after compilation and linking?

  section
    pre.
      <code class="html" data-trim>
      &lt;div ng-init="myVar = 1 + 2;"&gt;
        &lt;p ng-bind="myVar"&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      </code>

  section
    p Instead of using ng-bind, we can use the shorthand {{ }}

  section
    p The linker will execute the expression inside {{ }} on scope and replace it with the result.

  section
    pre.
      <code class="html" data-trim>
      &lt;div ng-init="myVar = 1 + 2;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{{myVar}}{{myVar + 1}}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      </code>

    p What will the DOM look like after compilation and linking?

  section
    pre.
      <code class="html" data-trim>
      &lt;div ng-init="myVar = 1 + 2;"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;34&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      </code>

  section
    h1 Modules

  section
    p You can think of a module as a container for the different parts of your app.

  section
    p Most applications have a main method that instantiates and wires together the different parts of the application.

  section
    p Angular apps don't have a main method. Instead, modules declaratively specify how an application should be bootstrapped.

  section
    p There are several advantages to this approach
    ul
      li The declarative process is easier to understand.
      li You can package code as reusable modules.
      li The modules can be loaded in any order because modules delay execution.

  section
    p The AngularJS team recommends you break up modules in the following way
    ul
      li A module for each feature
      li A module for each reusable component
      li An application level module which depends on the above modules and contains any initialization code

  section
    p What does a module look like?

  section
    p The code below creates a new module named 'app'
    br
    pre.
      <code class="js" data-trim>
      angular.module('app', []);

      </code>

  section
    p Modules can list other modules as their dependencies.

  section
    p Depending on a module implies that required module needs to be loaded before the requiring module is loaded.

  section
    p Each module will only be loaded once, even if multiple other modules require it.

  section
    p Below is an example of how to specify a module dependency.
    br
    pre.
      <code class="js" data-trim>
      angular.module('app', [
        'feature1'
      ]);

      angular.module('feature1', [
        'feature1.1'
      ]);

      angular.module('feature1.1', []);

      </code>

    p Notice the order.  Will this work?

  section
    p Yes.
    p
      | Because modules do nothing at load time, they can be loaded into the VM in any order and thus script
      | loaders can take advantage of this property and parallelize the loading process.

  section
    h1 Dependency
    h1 Injection

  section
    p Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern that deals with how code gets hold of its dependencies.

  section
    p
       | The Angular injector subsystem is in charge of service instantiation, resolution of dependencies, and
       | provision of dependencies to components as requested.

  section
    p
      | The simplest way to get hold of the dependencies, is to assume that the function parameter names are
      | the names of the dependencies.

  section
    p
      | Given a function, the injector can infer the names of the service to inject by examining the function
      | declaration and extracting the parameter names.

  section
    p The example below shows how to specify that $scope and myService need to be injected into the function.
    br
    pre.
      <code class="js" data-trim>
        function($scope, myService) {

        }

      </code>

  section
    p The argument based DI method doesn't always work, we'll elaborate on the reason in Lecture 12.

  section
    p Because of this complication, we can also use the array method for specifying dependencies.

  section
    p Below is the array method for injecting dependencies.
    br
    pre.
      <code class="js" data-trim>
        [
          '$scope',
          'myService',
          function($scope, myService) {

          }
        ]

      </code>
    p If we change the name of the function arguments, will DI still work?

  section
    p Yes.
    p
      | When using the array method, the injector service will use the strings as the dependency names
      | and inject those dependencies into the function arguments in order.

  section
    p Where can you use dependency injection in Angular?

  section
    p
      | DI is pervasive throughout Angular. You can use it in controllers, services, directives, filters,
      | animations, and run and config blocks (all of which we will discuss later)

  section
    h1 Controllers

  section
    p In Angular, a controller is a JavaScript constructor function that is used to augment the Angular Scope.

  section
    p You can create controllers on a module.  The first argument is the controller name, and the second is the constructor function.
    br
    pre.
      <code class="js" data-trim>
      angular.module('app.controllers', [])
        .controller('AppController',
          function() {

          }
        );

      </code>

  section
    p You should use controllers to
    ul
      li Set up the initial state of the scope.
      li Add behavior to the scope.

  section
    p You should not use controllers to
    ul
      li Manipulate DOM
      li Share code or state across controllers
      li Manage the life-cycle of other components
      li Format input
      li Format output

  section
    p We'll talk about other components that accomplish these functions later.

  section
    p In general, a controller shouldn't try to do too much.

  section
    p It should contain only the business logic needed for a single view.

  section
    p When creating a controller you can inject the new scope as well as other dependencies.
    br
    pre.
      <code class="js" data-trim>
      angular.module('app.controllers', [])
        .controller('AppController',
          function($scope, $interval) {

          }
        );

      </code>

  section
    p You can associate controllers with scope objects implicitly via the ngController directive.

  section
    p Controller
    pre.
      <code class="js" data-trim>
      angular.module('app.controllers', [])
        .controller('AppController',
          function($scope) {
            $scope.time = new Date();
          }
        );

      </code>

    p Template
    pre.
      <code class="html" data-trim>
      &lt;div ng-controller="AppController" &gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{{time}}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      </code>

  section(id="example1", ng-controller="AppController")
    p Final result
    pre.
      <code class="html" data-trim>
      &lt;div ng-controller="AppController" &gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{{time}}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      </code>

  section
    p Lets add some functionality to scope and show off data binding.

  section
    p The $interval service executes a function on scope in the supplied interval.
    pre.
      <code class="js" data-trim>
      angular.module('app.controllers', [])
        .controller('TimeController',
          function($scope, $interval) {
            // Set the value of $scope.time to 'now' every 10 ms
            $interval(function() {
              $scope.time = new Date();
            }, 10);
          }
        );

      </code>
    pre.
      <code class="html" data-trim>
      &lt;div ng-controller="TimeController"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{{time}}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      </code>

  section(id="example2", ng-controller="TimeController")
    h2(style="font-family: monospace;") {{time}}

  section
    p There's no magic happening here.
    p This demonstrates how changes on scope are reflected in the view once the DOM has been compiled and linked by Angular.

  section
    h1 Bootstrapping

  section
    p
      | Angular initializes automatically upon DOMContentLoaded event or when the angular.js script is evaluated if at that
      | time document.readyState is set to 'complete'.

  section
    p At this point Angular looks for the ng-app directive which designates your application root.

  section
    p Typically the ng-app directive is used on the root html or body elements so that the entire document is traversed and linked by the compiler.
    br
    pre.
      <code class="html" data-trim>
      &lt;html ng-app="app"&gt;

      &lt;/html&gt;
